# Password-Recovery-Module

A Password Recovery Module is a crucial component of many software systems and applications that require user authentication. Its primary purpose is to help users regain access to their accounts if they forget their passwords. Here are some key points about Password Recovery Modules:

User-Friendly Process: Password recovery modules are designed to be user-friendly. When a user forgets their password, they typically click on a "Forgot Password" or similar link on the login page. This action triggers the password recovery process.

Email Verification: One common method used by password recovery modules is to send an email to the user's registered email address. This email usually contains a unique link or a temporary code that allows the user to reset their password.

Security Measures: Security is a significant concern when it comes to password recovery. To ensure that only authorized users can reset their passwords, various security measures are employed. These can include CAPTCHA tests, email verification, or answering security questions.

Token Generation: Password recovery modules often generate unique tokens or links that are only valid for a limited time. This prevents malicious users from abusing the system.

User Identity Verification: In some cases, additional identity verification steps may be required, such as answering security questions or providing some personal information.

Password Reset: Once the user verifies their identity, they are typically allowed to set a new password for their account. The old password is invalidated.

Logging and Monitoring: It's important to log and monitor password recovery attempts to detect and prevent any suspicious activity.
